# 🛠️ HardwareForge

A Comprehensive PC Building Platform

HardwareForge is a web-based platform designed to help users build custom PCs, compare hardware, and generate optimized builds based on budget. It mimics real life market movement data and provides an intuitive experience for both beginners and enthusiasts.

## 🚀 Features
### 🔧 Custom PC Builder

* Select individual components (CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, PSU, case)

* Automatically calculate total build price

* Prevents incompatible selections (based on stored component data)

### 🎲 Random PC Build Generator

* Generate a complete PC build based on a user-defined budget

* Useful for inspiration, entry-level users, or quick recommendations

### 📊 Hardware Comparison Tool

* Compare CPUs or GPUs side-by-side

* Filter by category (budget, mid-range, high-end)

* View key specs such as cores, threads, clock speeds, wattage, and price

### 🏷️ Brand Insight Notes

* Displays brand strengths (e.g., AMD GPUs as a strong budget option)

* Helps users make informed decisions beyond raw specs

### 💾 Build Management

* Save completed builds to the database

* View, manage, and revisit saved builds

### 🌐 Centralized Hardware Data

* Hardware data stored in MySQL

* Product data mimics real life market movement

## 🧰 Tech Stack
### Frontend
